# Event API 

Hey guys!!!! 

Open the console if you are testing this part out.
Keywords I suggest you type in are: Los Angeles, Tampa, Lady Gaga, Orlando 

After you hit the search bar refresh!! I have not added a clear form function yet. 

It has its own index.html file, I renamed it so it doesnt 
confuse us with the index.html in the main branch.

Read through the comments, I decided to display some random data just to show how it works. Feel free to test out with different parameters or data. 

Code is messy!!! But we will fix it later on when merging with the HTML/CSS.
