# Changes made

The user can now only search by typing in their city in the United States.

Once search button is clicked a random event will appear. 

They will have two options. Yes they will go, No they will not go. 

If they click no, it will give another random event. 

If they click yes, it will give them the options to buy tickets with the google maps widget. 


Bugs:

1. does not display a 404 error message if someone types something other than a city 
2. should we put the disclaimer that it only searches cities in the United States, should we take a parameter for state along with it?
3. map does not have a red arrow indicating the exact location
4. two white boxes are present in search, lets make it so it appears while the map appears
